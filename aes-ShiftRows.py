"""aes-ShiftRows.py

ShiftRows operation for AES-128 ECB mode with FHE compatibility.

The ShiftRows operation performs cyclic left shifts on the rows of the AES state:
- Row 0: no shift
- Row 1: left shift by 1 position  
- Row 2: left shift by 2 positions
- Row 3: left shift by 3 positions

For our flat array layout (16 * max_blocks), we need to apply these shifts
within each 4x4 block while maintaining the batching structure.

Layout reminder:
- Flat array: [b0_all_blocks, b1_all_blocks, ..., b15_all_blocks]
- Each b_i segment has max_blocks elements
- Within each block: bytes 0,1,2,3 = row 0; bytes 4,5,6,7 = row 1; etc.
